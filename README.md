# CSBS Init

Concept website for our college bootcamp's project contest around Sep 2021.

Problem Statement: Design a website using basic CSS and HTML to portray the strength and features of the major/stream that you belong to.

Just like how `git init` initializes Git, Team `csbs init` strives to pioneer in technical affairs in our department and university.
We believe we _initialize_ activity and inspire those around us to outshine themselves each day. :D
