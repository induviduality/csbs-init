# Hi, hiii

Please feel free to open up a new html file and code your section out.
Look for your section name in `index.html` and replace the dummy text with your code.

## To replace dummy text
- Go to the section tags of the section you've chosen.
- Find the `<p>...</p>` tags and delete them along with the dummy text in it.
- Add your code in there!

The scroll and the links are working great
